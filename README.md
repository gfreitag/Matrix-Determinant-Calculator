# Matrix-Determinant-Calculator
A simple calculator for calculating the determinant of a matrix, written in C++.

This sort of calculator has been done many times in the past, but this is my attempt at a small personal project! This is also partially a way for me to re-learn C/C++.

If you happen to run across this project, please feel free suggest ways to simplify (of which I'm sure there are many) or expand on my code, or even make a pull request. This project is also my first Github project, so I'm very new to this!

My calculator will have many bugs at first, but I hope to get it finished by the end of this year. It's possible that I will try and expand on the project and add a GUI if I am still interested come January of 2019.

11/28/18: The calculator is not working. Ways of reducing the matrix to row-echelon form are needed, and the compiler is having problems with my arrays. Bugs-abound.
